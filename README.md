# TriviaGame

This is a Rock and Roll Trivia game built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and a bit of jQuery.  The game consists of 5 questions. When the user completes the quiz, it shows how many right, how many wrong, and the score.

The whole thing runs on a counter, cycling through arrays of content.  Feel free to peruse the code if you are building something similar.
